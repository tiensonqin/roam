#+TITLE: Symbol

Symbols are generally used to mark locations of programs or data, so you can
refer to them by name instead of by their location number.

for eg:
#+BEGIN_SRC asm
.globl _start
#+END_SRC

Here ~_start~ is a symbol.

~_start~ is a special symbol that always needs to be marked with ~.globl~ because
it marks the location of the start of the program
