One of the most popular and productive authors of the 19th century: He would
start every morning at 5:30 a.m. with a cup of coffee and a clock in front of
him. Then he would write at least 250 words every 15 minutes. This, he writes in
his autobiography: “allowed me to produce over ten pages of an ordinary novel
volume a day, and if kept up through ten months, would have given as its results
three novels of three volumes each in the year” (Trollope, 2008, 272). And that,
mind you, was before breakfast.  [[file:how_to_take_smart_notes.org][How to Take Smart Notes]]
