This could useful in the case we want to [[file:grep.org][grep]] something from ~.gz~ file without
needing to uncompress it.

For eg, in production environment, I'm logged in as user with very limited
access and uncompress is not an option. However I often need to do that when
examining log file for issue investigation.
