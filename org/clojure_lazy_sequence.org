"Lazy sequences are cached, so each element is realized only once, and then
stored instead of being recalculated. This means that expensive computations
won’t be run unnecessarily. It also means that it’s safe to have sequence
generating functions with side effects—they may not happen at all, if the
sequence is never realized, but they’ll never be executed repeatedly." [fn:1]
