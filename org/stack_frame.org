stack frame consists of all of the stack variables used within a function including:
- parameters
- local variables
- return address

* creates the stack frame for a function
- saves current [[file:base-pointer.org][base-pointer]] (%ebp) to top of [[file:stack.org][Stack]]
- copies the [[file:stack-pointer.org][stack-pointer]] (%esp) to [[file:base-pointer.org][base-pointer]] (%ebp)

#+BEGIN_SRC asm
pushl %ebp
movl %esp, %ebp
#+END_SRC

* restore previous stack frame
#+BEGIN_SRC asm
movl %ebp, %esp
popl %ebp
#+END_SRC

basically after set ~%esp~ value to ~%ebp~, now top of stack will point to where
%ebp is, this effectively just like removes all local variables from [[file:stack.org][Stack]]

Then after pop the top of stack and put into ~%ebp~, now top of stack is
function's [[file:return_address.org][return address]]. This prepares things for [[file:ret_instruction.org][ret instruction]].
