software interrrupts

Software interrupts are similar in principle but a bit different in practice.
CPUs support special instructions that allow the software to simulate an
interrupt. When such an instruction is executed, the CPU treats it like an
interrupt - stops its normal flow of execution, saves its state and jumps to a
handler routine. Such "traps" allow many of the wonders of modern OSes (task
scheduling, virtual memory, memory protection, debugging) to be implemented
efficiently
