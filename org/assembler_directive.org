Anything starting with *a period* isn't directly translated into a machine
instruction Instead. it's an instruction to the assembler itself.

For eg:
#+BEGIN_SRC asm
.section .text
#+END_SRC
starts the [[file:text_section.org][text section]]


~.globl~ means that the assembler shouldnt discard this symbol after assembly
because the linker will need it.
