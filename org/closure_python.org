- reference :: [[file:fluent_python.org][Fluent Python]]

a closure is a function with an extended scope that encompasses nonglobal
variables referenced in the body of the function but not defined there. It does
not matter whether the function is anonymous or not; what matters is that it can
access nonglobal variables that are defined outside of its body.
