* case-insensitive search
I'd like to and so on while
replacing or performing other operations.

GNU sed and other version does support a case-insensitive search using ~I~ flag
after ~/regex/~ so it will match all combination of word like ~foo~, ~FOO~, ~FoO~.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat file.txt | sed -e 's/target/replace-word/gI'
#+END_SRC

* how to use bash variable in sed?
surround bash variable with single quote(').

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sed -i '/-I$__LIB_DIR$/i '$bash_var'' $compiler_option
#+END_SRC

* how to search and replace pattern which contains /
use another character, like ~#~ instead of ~/~

* how to replace a character(like |) with a TAB?
this one is very tricky than it looks. I tried several ways, only this one seems
work:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sed -i 's/|/'$'\t''/g' $compiler_option
#+END_SRC

* why I saw the error message like "sed: -e expression #1, char 11: unknown option to `s'"
Seems it's most likely that something you use(either pattern or string
to be replaced to) has / which cause the trouble. To solve this, try use #
instead of / as delimiter.

* how to provide multiple patterns for a sed command?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sed -i 's/target1/replace1/g s/target2/replace2/g' $input_file
#+END_SRC
