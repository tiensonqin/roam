- reference :: [[file:fluent_python.org][Fluent Python]]
 
A object which call operator (i.e., ()) can be applied to.

To determine whether an object is callable, use the ~callable()~ built-in
function.

The Python Data Model lists seven callable types:

- User-defined functions :: Created with def statements or lambda expressions.
- Built-in functions :: A function implemented in C (for CPython), like len or time.strftime.
- Built-in methods :: Methods implemented in C, like dict.get.
- Methods :: Functions defined in the body of a class.
- Classes
- Class instances
- Generator functions

To create User-Defined Callable, just implementing a ~__call__~ instance
method.
