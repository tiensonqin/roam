Processors have a number of different ways of accessing data, known as
addressing modes.

[[file:immediate_mode_addressing.org][immediate mode addressing]]

The general form of memory address references:

#+begin_example
ADDRESS_OR_OFFSET(%BASE_OR_OFFSET, %å·¥NDEX, MULTIPLIER)
#+end_example

#+begin_example
FINAL ADDRESS = ADDRESS_OR_OFFSET + %BASE_OR_OFFSET + MULTIPLIER * %INDEX
#+end_example

ADDRESS_OR_OFFSET and MULTIPLIER must both be constants, while the other two
must be registers. If any of the pieces is left out, it is just substituted with
zero in the equation.
