volatile keyword tells compile the variable could be changed unexpectedly, so
its value should always be read from memory, instead of register(since compilers
may do optimization, access register is faster than memory)

a variable should be declared as volatile when:

- its value could be changed by another thread
- its value could be changed by hardware
