* where the function default parameter is stored?
The default parameter will always be resolved at the *calling location*.

Few possibilities:
- A temporary will be created
- compiler may opt to put a const in the data segment.
- immediate argument to a machine instruction to load the value into a register or to push the value onto the stack (for something like int)

I'm not sure you could say "where the default parameter is stored" other than to
say that the description of it's value is in the function declaration. You might
want to compile some code that uses default parameters and look at the resulting
assembly. I'm fairly certain the answer is that it's *implementation specific*.
