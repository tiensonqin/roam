Well, the first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember
isolated facts and try and bang ’em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a
latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form. You’ve got to have
models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience, both vicarious and
direct, on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just
try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and
in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your
head. [fn:1]
