#+TITLE: World Clock in Emacs

[[file:Emacs.org][Emacs]] has this ~display-time-world~ function which displays time for few
predefined countries around the world like London, New York and Tokyo.

The time will also refresh byitself without leaving the buffer, could be
convenient.

Will check back tomorrow see if it can correctly identify the timezone for
London to become ~BST~ or not, currently it's shown as ~GMT~.
